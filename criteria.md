# Acceptance criteria — TakeMeter

Five criteria that say what "working" means for this classifier, written in
unit 5 **before** anything was trained.

**All five are yours this time.** None are given. You've had two projects of
practice.

An acceptance criterion names a number. *"The model is accurate"* is an
opinion. *"Every label has an F1 of at least 0.60 on the held-out set"* is a
criterion.

Under each, write a sentence or two on **why that number**. A reason that says
something about your data or your taxonomy earns credit — *"I picked 0.60 F1
for `reaction` because it's my smallest label and I only have about 50
examples of it"*. A reason that could be attached to any project does not.

> Missing your own targets next unit costs you nothing. Setting a target so
> easy you can't miss it does.

## Pick numbers you can defend

Not numbers that sound impressive. Three labels means a coin-flip guesser gets
about 33%, so a target of 0.40 is barely a target. Your number should sit
somewhere you'd honestly call useful.

**Cover at least three of these five areas.** They're here as prompts, not as a
form to fill in — a criterion that fits none of them is fine if it names a
number.

| Area | A question it could answer |
|---|---|
| Overall accuracy | How often does it need to be right to be worth using? |
| Per-label performance | Is one label allowed to be much worse than the others? |
| Balance | How lopsided can your label counts get before it's a problem? |
| Consistency | If someone else labelled the same posts, how often should you agree? |
| Confidence | Should a confident prediction be right more often than an unsure one? |

Two things worth knowing before you pick numbers, because both will affect
whether you hit them:

- **Your smallest label will have the jumpiest score.** If a label has 50
  examples, about 8 land in the test split. An F1 computed on 8 examples moves
  a lot between seeds. A target for that label should be looser than one for
  your biggest label, and saying so is a good reason.
- **Unit 6 tests across three seeds, and the target has to hold across all
  three.** A target of 0.65 against results of 0.71, 0.62, 0.68 is a **miss**.
  Pick with that in mind — it is stricter than it first sounds.

## 1. Balance - Each target label must account for a minimum of 25% of the total dataset

<!-- Your criterion. It must name a number. -->



**Why this target:** Prevents trained model from biasing any of the other labels. It also ensures that even the smallest label has a large enough footprint within the dataset to be recognized. A perfect 33% for each label is unreasonable with a sample size of ~200 posts.



---

## 2. Accuracy - Every label's F1 score is greater than 60%

<!-- Your criterion. -->



**Why this target:** Ensures model accuracy. A model that predicts two labels correct 80% of the time, and one label correct 30% of the time could have a total accuracy of ~50%. There is zero utility for a model that cannot predict all three labels separately. 



---

## 3. Per-label performance - Accuracy spread across the three labels is <= 10%

<!-- Your criterion. -->

**Why this target:** Label accuracy should fit within a tight bind. It also protects against the model predicting the dominant class when paired with a minimum of 25% of total data per label

---

## 4. At least 60% of the content on the bonadary between `analysis` and `guide` are sorted correctly

<!-- Your criterion. -->



**Why this target:** We have an ambiguity boundary defined between these two labels, and the model should be able to discern between the two at least by the min rate of accuracy for all three labels.



---

## 5. Accuracy spread across several seeds is at most 10%

<!-- Your criterion. -->

**Why this target:**

     UNIT 6 — read this before you change anything above.

     If a criterion turns out to be BROKEN rather than merely unmet, you can
     revise it, and that earns credit. But never delete or edit the original
     line. Add the revision underneath, like this:

         ## 2. Every label performs acceptably

         The model performs well on all labels.

         **Why this target:** ...

         > **Revised in unit 6:** Every label has an F1 of at least 0.60 on
         > the held-out set.
         >
         > **Why revised:** "performs well" gave me nothing to check. I
         > couldn't produce a verdict from it at all.

     That's a revision because the criterion couldn't be MEASURED.

     Lowering a target because you missed it is not a revision, and it costs
     you the point:

         ✗ "Overall accuracy of at least 0.65" → "at least 0.55", because
            0.65 turned out to be optimistic for 200 examples.

     A number you missed stays where it is, gets diagnosed, and gets a fix
     attempted. That's where the points are.
